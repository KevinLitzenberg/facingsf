An online street art photo blog. 

Uses an AWS LEMP (NGINX) Stack on Ubuntu 16.04.

Repo contains files from previous install on Ubuntu 14.04.  Since 14.04 used php5 as default the files that end in *.php5 can be used.

The files ending *.php are the actual files used on the AWS instance.  The *.php5 are merely here for referance.
